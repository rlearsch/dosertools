# dostools

dostools is a Python package for analyzing dripping-onto-substrate rheology videos.\
The software converts an input video into a series of binary images, produces a dataset of $\frac{R}{R_0}$ and time values for each frame in the video, and generates values for for the elongational relaxation time $\lambda_E$, the radius at critical time $\frac{R(t_c)}{R_0}$, and a guess for the quantity of (elongational viscosity / surface tension) $\frac{\eta_E}{\sigma}$.
